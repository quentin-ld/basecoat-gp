# basecoat-gp - Starter Theme
basecoat-gp is a simple WordPress starter theme designed for building generatepress child themes, featuring a development workflow with pre-made PHP includes for CSS and JS on both the front-end and Gutenberg editor, PHP linting, a modern build process using esbuild, and a zip export function for easy manual deployment.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- PHP **7.4 or higher** (tested up to PHP 8.4)
- Composer
- Node.js & npm
- WordPress >= **6.0**

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
composer install
npm install
```

## Development Workflow

### 🧹 Code Quality
basecoat-gp enforces strict coding standards and static analysis to avoid bugs and maintain clean code.

#### PHP Linting
Run PHP linting with:

```bash
composer run lint:php
```

This will:
- Use **PHP CS Fixer** to automatically fix code style issues.
- Use **PHPStan** for static analysis and bug detection.

#### JavaScript Linting
Lint your JavaScript files using ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint-js
```

This will:
- Check for code quality and consistency.
- Automatically fix some issues using Prettier & ESLint.

#### SCSS Linting
Lint SCSS files with Prettier:

```bash
npm run lint-scss
```

This will:
- Format SCSS code according to a consistent style.
- Automatically fix code style issues where possible.

### Code Build
The build process uses esbuild and npm scripts configured in the `.config` directory. Below are the key build commands:

#### Build All
Run the complete build process:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will:
- Lint SCSS files
- Build CSS from SCSS
- Lint JavaScript files
- Lint PHP files
- Generate translations
- Create a zip archive of the theme

#### Build CSS
Compile SCSS files into CSS, generating sourcemaps for easier debugging.

```bash
npm run build-css
```

This will:
- Compile SCSS files into minified CSS (theme.css).
- Create source maps for easier debugging (theme.css.map).

#### Build JavaScript
Build JavaScript files using esbuild:

```bash
npm run build-js
```

This will:
- Bundle and minify JavaScript files.
- Create optimized output for production.

#### Watch Files
Watch SCSS and JavaScript files and trigger rebuilds automatically.

```bash
npm run watch
```

This will:
- Watch all SCSS and JavaScript files for changes.
- Trigger a rebuild whenever a change is detected.

#### Generate Translations
Generate translation files:

```bash
npm run build-i18n
```

This will:
- Extract translatable strings from the theme.
- Generate `.pot` files for translation.

#### Zip Theme
Create a zip archive of the theme.

```bash
npm run zip-theme
```

This will:
- Create a `.zip` archive of the theme, excluding unnecessary files like `node_modules` and `.git`.
- Save the archive in the root directory of the project (e.g., `basecoat-gp.zip`).

##### Uploading Your Theme

Once the zip file is created, you can upload it to a WordPress site:

1. Log in to the WordPress admin dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Appearance > Themes**.
3. Click **Add New** and then click **Upload Theme**.
4. Choose the zip file (`basecoat-gp.zip`) generated by the build process and click **Install Now**.
5. After installation, click **Activate** to use the theme.
